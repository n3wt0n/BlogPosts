Today's video is very special, we have managed to put on an __exclusive double interview between Azure DevOps and GitHub__! 

We tried and asked the most common questions about the 2 platforms, which I receive on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DavideBenvegnu), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CoderDaveYT), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidebenvegnu/) and email almost on daily basis, but let me know in the comment section below if you have any other question, I will try and answer to everyone.

### The Interview

Alright, let's see what our 2 _honorable guests_ have to say. ;)

> Note: this was recorded few months back, some things might have changed in the mean time. For example, now __GitHub Actions CAN be [triggered manually](https://youtu.be/uNYDgUBClYY)__

### Wrap up

This double interview was of course done in a _silly_ way, but I've tried to squeeze in most of the __questions I receive almost on daily basis__, and I hope you found it interesting and you had an answer for some of your questions or doubts.

Let me know in the comment section below if you have another question I haven't answered in this video, I will try and answer to everyone.

I hope you had fun watching this interview because I had a ton of fun making it!
