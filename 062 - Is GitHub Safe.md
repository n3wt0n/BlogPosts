I saw a lot of messages and questions like "__Is GitHub Safe?__", "__Would my code be safe on GitHub?__", and many others along this line. It seems there are only vague answers to that on the internet so with the below video I want to __give you clear answers__ to the following questions and topics:

- Is GitHub safe to use? Platform safety
- Tracking cookies on GitHub
- GitHub's transparency report
- Security Incident Response Team
- Is my code on GitHub safe?
- What can we do to be safer?
- What about Authentication on GitHub?
- Tools for a safer GitHub
- Are GitHub Actions safe?

And I've teamed up with [Anthony Borton](https://twitter.com/anthonyborton) (DevOps Architect @ GitHub) to bring you all the information you need.
