Just less than 4 days ago __Nasa has made history__ once again, flying a helicopter on Mars for the first time in human history. And that has been possible thanks to many __brilliant researchers, scientists, and engineers__... but also __thanks to Open Source Software and GitHub__.

### Intro

Today's post is a special one, it is a celebration of an __incredible achievement__ for the teams at NASA and the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL). 

Less than 4 days before the publishing of this post, in fact, we all watched in awe as the first Mars Helicopter, Ingenuity, took flight in the thin Martian atmosphere.

But this is not only an achievement for Nasa and JPL. It's __a big day for Open Source, and for GitHub__. 

### A Win for Open Source

In fact, __nearly 12,000 developers on GitHub__ contributed to Ingenuity’s software via open source.

Moreover, Nasa's JPL itself has used GitHub for managing this project.

As you can see above, someone in the control room is tracking the __progress on a GitHub Issue__ mere minutes before the take off.

and later on they have the GitHub screen open on the big screen that everyone in the control room can see, once again to manage the progress of the pre-flight moments.

### GitHub Achievements Badges

GitHub is also using this opportunity to __introduce a new Achievements section to the GitHub profile__.

Right now, Achievements include the _Mars 2020 Helicopter Mission_ badge, the _Arctic Code Vault_ badge, and a badge for sponsoring open source work via _GitHub Sponsors_.

but watch out this space because __new badges will be added overtime__ to celebrate and award developers in regard of special project, or incredible successes like the first helicopter flight in space.

### Conclusions

Let me know in the comment section below if you have received one or more of these badges and post your GitHub handle.

Once again, __congratulations to the teams at NASA and JPL, and to the thousands of developers__ who made today’s first Martian flight possible. We’re all still here on Earth, but our code is now on Mars!
