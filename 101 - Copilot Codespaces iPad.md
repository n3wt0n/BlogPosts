Do you know you can __develop any application on your iPad__? Well, thanks to Codespaces you can!

In this live streaming I'm going to have a quick demo of using GitHub __Codespaces on iPad__, and we will also see __GitHub Copilot in action within Codespaces__.

I will also answer all your __questions about GitHub Codespaces__. So prepare your questions! And if you can't make it, __post your questions or comments down below__ so I can address them during the live!
