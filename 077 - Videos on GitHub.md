Today we talk about uploading and using videos in GitHub.

### Intro

As developers, the ability to __collaborate through videos__ (for example, pair programming, demos, etc.) is an extremely important part of a software workflow, especially for communities and teams that are distributed.

__GitHub video support is now finally GA__, so let's see how it works

### Video

Let's quickly see how to upload a video in GitHub, and then let's explore few scenarios where this can be very helpful:

### Scenarios

As you have seen, uploading a video in GitHub Issues, Pull Requests and Discussions is super straight forward. I wanna share __3 scenarios__ in which uploading a video can be helpful.

#### Help Maintainers Reproduce Bugs

Bugs are something that every developer deals with, but sometimes words aren’t enough to help someone else reproduce the problem quickly. And bug reports very often require significant back and forth with the user to get to the root of the issue.

By enabling users to upload videos we have the ability to visually reproduce the way a bug is identified and significantly decrease the time spent to try and reproduce it.

#### Provide Context on Pull Requests

There’s a lot of context about requirements, architecture decisions, and more captured on GitHub in issues and pull requests.

Developers can utilize video to share more details about complex code changes with colleagues by providing walkthroughs, demos of functionality, and other important context to maximize their review feedback.

#### Feature Showcase

Last scenario in which using a video can be useful is sharing how a feature might take shape.

When it comes to developing a new feature or product, a written proposal or static design are great, but often lack the ability to really show the end-to-end user workflows and interactions.

Sharing videos of prototype walkthroughs or providing talk tracks for a static design have also helped development teams get to the heart of what they are setting out to build and why so they can get others excited about their work and ultimately build a better product for their own users.

### Mobile App Support

Almost done, but first the proverbial cherry on the cake: uploading videos is also __available from both the iOS and Android GitHub mobile apps__.

This is especially useful for mobile developers who can now record a video of a mobile bug and upload it straight to an issue all from the same device.

### Conclusions

What do you think? Is this a feature that is important or valuable to you? let me know in the comment section below.
