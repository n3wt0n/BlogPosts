Still confused about DevOps and ALM tools?

I personally think every tool is good, but Azure DevOps is just better!

What makes Azure DevOps so good for Startups, SMBs and Enterprises?

It's things like Azure Pipelines, Security, Pricing, Extensions, and many more.

These are the __top 10 reasons why Azure DevOps is just better__!

_(Note: the reasons are not in any specific order)_

### Reasons

1. It's modular, but fully integrated
2. Azure Pipelines
3. Enterprise features (_Audit, Security, ..._)
4. Geographic presence (_it's the most distributed DevOps tool ever!_)
5. Azure Boards
6. Pricing (_Boy if it is cheap!_)
7. Dashboards
8. Fully Customizable
9. Best for Azure, perfect for everything else too
10. Integrations and Extensions
