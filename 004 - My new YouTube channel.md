I'm finally super excited to announce I have started my new [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtiFg7r8WBBzC6xo-tfEYFw), called [__CoderDave__](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtiFg7r8WBBzC6xo-tfEYFw).

In this channel I'm going to talk about _DevOps_, _Azure_, _Coding_ and everything _Microsoft_.

I will upload a new technical video each week, on Tuesday, and be sure not to miss also the Friday night show (well, that depends on your time zone, but for me in Hong Kong that is Friday Night). During the show, we will review the latest news about Microsoft and Azure. The show is called "The M&AN Show", which stands for **M**icrosoft __&__ **A**zure **N**ews.

I also often speak at conferences and technical events, so I plan to make a series of videos to take _YOU_ inside those conferences.

If you don't want to miss a thing, just be sure to subscribe () and turn on the notifications.

See you soon on [CoderDave](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtiFg7r8WBBzC6xo-tfEYFw)!
