Today I wanna show you how you can make money on GitHub. I will tell you exactly what to do and why people would want to sponsor you.

Let's get into it.

### Intro

Today I will walk you through how you can make money and get paid while working on Open Source projects on GitHub. And there are a couple of different ways to do so, but before we see the how, let me ask you something: 

__Are you providing value to users and developers?__

It is __VERY IMPORTANT__ to understand this, because it is not GitHub paying you for the work you do, it's other users, other developers and possibly companies. 

If you create a project that is useful to the community, or perhaps you have a library and people use that because it is valuable, then they may decide to send you some money, __to sponsor you for your work__.

And ___why would they do that___? Well, one reason could be that they really love your work and they want to show you appreciation and support. But often the reason is that __they are depending on your work__, and so they want to make sure your project, library or whatever else you're doing keeps __getting updated and supported__ thorough time.

And this of course is even more __important for companies__. Before December 2020 only developers and single users where enabled to sponsor other people's projects. But now also companies can do that.  There are so many companies that use Open Source libraries and components, and now through donations and sponsorships they can __support the projects__ they use and need, and again make sure they are supported and updated thorough time.

Alright, now that understand the mechanics behind that, let's see how we can make this happen, how we can enable users and companies to send us money.

### Video

To see how to __enable the monetization__ on your GitHub profile and repos, I've created a video in which I explain __step by step__ what you need to do.

Here you have it, enjoy the watch!

### Conclusion

Remember that you need to __apply for the GitHub Sponsor program__ before being able to enable it. And also make sure you deliver value to other users, developers, and companies. Otherwise most likely they will not send you money and sponsor your projects.

Let me know in the comment section below what you think about this, if you are in the GitHub sponsor program already, and if you have people sponsoring you.
