Keeping your dependencies updated is one of the easiest ways to __keep the software you build secure__. Unfortunately, it is also one of the most overlooked.

Luckily for us, __GitHub Dependabot__ can help with this, by updating your dependencies automatically, so you can spend less time updating dependencies and more time building.

### How does Dependabot work?

Let's quickly see how Dependabot works and then we'll see how to enable and use it.

First step, Dependabot __pulls down your dependency__ files and looks for any outdated or insecure requirements.

Then, if any of your dependencies are out-of-date, __Dependabot opens individual pull requests__ to update each of them.

Finally, you can check that your tests pass, scan the included changelog and release notes, and if everything looks ok, merge the changes back to your code.

### How to Enable Dependabot?

Enabling Dependabot is really easy.

First, fo to the _Security_ tab of your repository, then click on the _Enable Dependabot Alerts_ button.

At this point another screen will appear:

The first button you have to click on to __enable Dependabot__ on your repository is the one I've highlighted in red. And technically this is all you need to have Dependabot enabled and look for vulnerabilities.

However, we want to take this __a step further__.

If you click on the other button, the one highlighted in green, Dependabot will be able to __automatically create pull requests__ for you to fix your vulnerable dependencies!

This is what we want, don't we? 👴🏻
