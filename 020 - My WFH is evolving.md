Back in March, I posted for the first time [my home office setup](https://dev.to/n3wt0n/my-home-office-revealed-1l42)

Since then, many things have changed... and many will still change in the future.

For this reason, given the ever changing nature of my WFH setup, I've decided to create a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/n3wt0n/work-from-home-setup) to host the information.

I've chosen GitHub because it is much easier to keep it __always up-to-date__ and also because it will be much easier seeing the changes overtime, given the Version Control behind the scenes.

### This is my current setup:
