__What is a linter__? How does a linter work? Why __should I use a linter__?

These questions, and many more, come up every time I talk about linting to some teams. For this reason I've put together this "__linting explained__" type of video, in which I will try and answer all of the most common questions about linters. We will also see why is a linter important, and how linter works.
