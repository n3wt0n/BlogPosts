What is your opinion on ___multiple applications/services in a single docker container___?

For me, __1 container = 1 app/service__, no exceptions allowed.

What do you think?

1. One container = one service, no exception allowed
2. Multiple services are ok
3. Usually one service per container, but exceptions may make sense

If you are on the 2nd or 3rd option, I'd love to know why you have multiple services/applications per container... or what exceptions you see fit. Let me know in the comments!
