The new GitHub Issues and Project Boards are here, and they are __pretty cool__! Today we are gonna see all the __new and updated features__, and what we can do with them.

Let's get into it.

### What Has Been Announced and Availability

There are 3 main new features as part of this release: __Issue Forms__, __Task Lists__, and __Table View + Boards__ in the Projects.

Let's start with availability:

Currently they are all released in __beta__, with some differences.

Both Issue Forms and Task list are in __public beta__, available to everyone on every plan. Issue forms, however, are currently available only __Public Repositories__.

The new Table view and Boards, on the other hand, are in __Limited Beta__. To get access to it you need to request it at the link [https://github.com/features/issues](https://github.com/features/issues).

### What Is New?

With that out of the way, what is new? Well... a lot!

The new capabilities of Projects include things like issue hierarchy, __custom fields__, a spreadsheet-like table, and saved views - __all built into GitHub__.

And for the Issue Forms, they provide __improved issue template__ with a form layout that can use optional and validated fields and values. This allows to better manage the influx of bugs, features, and general requests by making each of them more actionable.

### Video

Alright, enough talking. Let's see this in action. We'll take a look first at the issue forms and task lists, and then we will move to the new boards.

### Conclusions

I can think of a thousand scenarios in which all of this could be beneficial, but I'd love to know how you would use this. Let me know in the comments below.

All those new features are pretty cool. I mean, obviously they can't replace tools like Azure Boards or Jira for complex projects __just yet__, but I believe __GitHub is on the right track__ with this.

The new Project Boards and Tables connect your planning directly to the work your teams are doing, and flexibly adapt to whatever your team needs at any point. And now with custom fields, you can use to track a sprint, plan a feature, or manage a large-scale release.

I'm pretty excited to see what this will evolve to be, and I think having everything we need directly in GitHub is a big plus.

But I'd like to know what you think about this, so let me know in the comment section below ok?
