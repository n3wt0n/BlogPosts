So __you want to learn GitHub__ and you want to learn it quick. Well, I have just the right tool for you.

It's called __GitHub Learning Lab__, and it is completely free.

### Intro

Today we talk about how you can __learn to use Git and GitHub quickly__ and effectively while having fun, thanks to [GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com).

GitHub Learning Lab is an __online platform__ created by GitHub with the help of the community, where you can __grow your skills by completing fun, realistic projects__.

And the best part is that it is __completely free__!

### How Does It Work?

As the website says, there are __no simulations or boring tutorials__.

You learn new skills while __working on your own copy of a real project__, with the instructions and feedback provided by the GitHub Bot. And the bot does so interacting with you __via the Issues and Pull Requests sections of the project__. It basically "_force you_" to work on the issues, like you would do in a __real project__ hosted on GitHub.

To learn, you can follow pre-defined __Learning Paths__, or you can freely choose the course, topic, or even languages you want to learn. Just scroll down on the page, and you will have a selection of many, __many different learning possibilities__.

You can even learn __Enterprise-related topics and skills__!

And you can always __search for other topics__, if want something different from the highlighted ones.

Because of the great content and the way it works, __GitHub Learning Lab is ideal for both beginners__ who want to learn GitHub from scratch and __users that are already familiar__ with GitHub but want to improve in some specific areas.

Alright, let's see how this works.

### Video

To better show how GitHub Learning Lab works, I've created a video with a comprehensive demo, because this is much better shown then told... So you can see by yourself how incredibly easy and effective the whole experience is.

### Conclusions

So, what do you think of the GitHub Learning Lab? I think it is great that they have __so much content completely for free__. And the format works perfectly, because you get to __do things rather than just following some tutorial__.

And the fact that the bot "force you" to work through issues like you would do in a real project it's a __big plus__ for me.
