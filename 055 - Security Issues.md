Today we talk about __security and vulnerabilities__, and how to approach and manage them in a __DevOps__ context.

### Intro

Let's say your team or some other team has __identified a security issue or vulnerability__ in your application, system, or anything else.

How to approach the __remediation__? How and when to work on it?

### Video

As usual, if you are a __visual learner__, or simply prefer to watch and listen instead of reading, here you have __the video with the whole explanation and demo__, which to be fair is much ___more complete___ than this post.

If you rather prefer reading, well... let's just continue :)

### About Critical Issues

First of all, needless to say, if that issue is __critical__, like for example it could lead to information theft or to compromise sensitive data, you should __fix it right away__ and deploy it as soon and as quick as possible. I think we can all agree on this.

This is a scenario, however, which __should rarely happen__ if you do security in the right way. I will soon have a whole article and video about "_doing security right_" so stick around if you don't want to miss it :).

Let's focus instead on issues that are not critical, of course we still need to work on them. What is the best way to approach this "additional work", if you will?

### How to Handle Issues and Vulnerabilities

Well, I hope this is not a surprise to you but... the best thing you can do is __make it part of your normal work__.

What does this mean? Well, simply put it means you should plan for it in your sprints or iterations, and ___have your team work on them as you do on all the other features___, tasks and stories.

This is the key: __plan for it__. Make it part of your daily work, have everyone in your team take up some of that work.

If you leave the security work like a sort of __extemporary work__, what will inevitably happen is that you will __increase your technical debt__.

If you instead make it part of the __normal work__, everyone will get __used to work on that__ if needed and so the issues will be solved in a timely manner.

___Final pro tip___: don't do this only for security issues and vulnerabilities, but treat security improvements the same way and you'll see your software getting better and more secure in a really short time.

### Conclusions

So, what do you think of this approach? How do you manage and resolve your security issues and vulnerabilities?
