Today I'm going to show you exactly what to do to create a __Personal Access Token in Azure DevOps__.

After the [article](https://dev.to/n3wt0n/how-to-create-a-personal-access-token-pg7) and the [video](https://youtu.be/SzrETQdGzBM) of a couple of weeks ago about the creation of Personal Access Tokens in GitHub, today I have for you a step by step guide on how to __create a PAT in Azure DevOps__.

### Intro

As we have seen in the other article and video I've mentioned before, Personal access tokens (PATs) are an alternative to using passwords for authentication when using APIs or the command line, or if we want to integrate with any 3rd party system.

Let's see how we can create a PAT in Azure DevOps

### Video

To see how to __create a PAT__ on your Azure DevOps, and how to properly scope it, I've created a video in which I explain __step by step__ what you need to do.

Here you have it, enjoy the watch!

### Conclusions

As you have seen, creating a PAT in Azure DevOps is slightly faster than doing it in GitHub, but the process is anyway very similar.

Let me know in the comment section below if you have any question about PATs in Azure DevOps.
