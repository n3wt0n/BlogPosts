Deploying your applications to __Kubernetes__ is not easy. Unless until now!

Let me show you how you can __deploy to AKS in less than 5 minutes__ and without even writing your Kubernetes deployment files and you CICD scripts.

Let's get into it.

### Intro

Today I want to show you how easy it could be to deploy to Kubernetes, thanks to the power AKS (_Azure Kubernetes Service_) and _GitHub_.

Using the __AKS Deployment center__, you don't need to write the Kubernetes YAML manifest files. Actually you don't even need to create your CICD workflows!

___All you need is a Dockerfile___ for your application, and 5 minutes of your time.

### Video

They say an image is worth 100 words... _or something like that_...

So I made a video for you, because this is much better shown then told... So you can see by yourself how incredibly easy and automated the whole experience is.

### Conclusions

Alright, that's it for today. That was really quick and easy, right?

Let me know in the comment section below what you think about the AKS deployment center. Of course it is not suitable for all the scenarios, especially the more complex ones, but I think it's a hell of a tool to use especially when you are getting started with Kubernetes.
