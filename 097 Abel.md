__Abel Wang__ (1972-2021) was Principal Program Manager, Technical Assistant to the CTO of Azure at Microsoft. 

For many years he was a DevOps enthusiast, and in fact he worked as DevOps Lead and Advocate in the Donovan Brown's team until the recent promotion.

You may know him by his nickname _AbelSquidHead_. He used to be a speaker at many technical events and conferences, and also either a host or guest of countless videos.

Abel was hands down one of the __most passionate DevOps practitioners__ I've ever had the pleasure to listen to. Actually, he was one of the most passionate people in everything he did.

__He passed away in July 2021__, cancer took him away.

This is my small tribute to him, to one of the best of us all.

In memory of Abel Wang. Rest in Peace. You are and will always be __sorely missed__.
