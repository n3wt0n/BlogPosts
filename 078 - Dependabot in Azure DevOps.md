If you want to have __automated vulnerability scanning in Azure DevOps__, this is for you! 

In this live streaming, part of the "_Build Live with Me_" series, I will show how to __add Dependabot to Azure DevOps__ and how it works.

Keeping track of any outdated dependencies can be a real nightmare, especially if you have lots of them. This is where Dependabot enters the ring. You can usually find it only in GitHub, but this time I'm adding it into Azure DevOps and Im gonna do it live with you.
