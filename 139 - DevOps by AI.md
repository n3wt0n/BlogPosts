What happens when AI does DevOps? Is it reliable? And does it make any sense at all?

I've asked AI about DevOps, and today we will discover what it said...

### Intro

I’m sure you have probably heard of ChatGPT, the new AI bot from OpenAI. This technology is _somewhat mature_, even tho it’s technically still a research preview, and I’ve seen it used in multiple different ways, even for YouTube videos. The problem is that __the results are not always very good__.

![ChatGPT preview](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6674b1c2vtflq0kul6qf.png)

For example, Kile Hill has used AI to create [a video about Black Holes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfnjxMS2RM)… and yeah, that didn’t make any sense whatsoever.

On another video tho, Linus from LTT asked ChatGPT to help him [choose the component for a PC and actually assemble it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuTTAuUorsI), and the result was brilliant.

So today I decided to __try it out for myself__ and have ___AI telling me about DevOps___.

I have asked A.I. the following 4 questions:

- Explain DevOps in simple terms
- How to do DevOps?
- Is DevOps beneficial for any company size?
- What is the best way to start with DevOps?

### Video

I've also generated some "DevOps-related" images using OpenAI’s DALL-E service. If you want to see those AI-generated images side-by-side with the AI DevOps, or simply prefer to watch and listen instead of reading, here you have __the video with the whole text an images__.

If you rather prefer reading, well... let's just continue :)

### DevOps by A.I.

> ___What follows is what ChatGPT created for me, word by word.___

DevOps is a software development approach that emphasizes collaboration and communication between developers and operations staff. The goal of DevOps is to improve the speed and quality of software delivery by automating processes, integrating testing and deployment, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement.

One of the key principles of DevOps is "infrastructure as code," which means that instead of manually configuring and managing servers and other infrastructure components, teams use code and automated tools to define and manage these resources. This enables them to rapidly provision, scale, and update their infrastructure in a consistent and repeatable way.

Another important aspect of DevOps is the use of agile methodologies, which focus on iterative, incremental development and the ability to quickly respond to change. This allows teams to deliver new features and updates to customers more quickly and efficiently.

Overall, DevOps aims to improve the collaboration and communication between different teams in an organization, and to streamline and automate the software delivery process.

There are many ways to practice DevOps, and the specific approaches and tools that a team uses will depend on their specific needs and goals. However, here are some general steps that teams can follow to adopt a DevOps approach:

1. Establish a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement: One of the key foundations of DevOps is a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement. This means fostering a mindset of shared responsibility and openness to change across all teams, and encouraging regular communication and feedback.
2. Automate and standardize processes: Automating and standardizing processes can help teams reduce errors, improve efficiency, and ensure consistent results. This can include automating tasks such as testing, deployment, and infrastructure management.
3. Use agile methodologies: Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, emphasize iterative, incremental development and the ability to quickly respond to change. Adopting agile practices can help teams deliver new features and updates more quickly and efficiently.
4. Implement continuous integration and delivery: Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) involves automatically building, testing, and deploying code changes as they are made. This can help teams release new features and updates more quickly and safely.
5. Monitor and measure: Monitoring and measuring the performance of systems and processes can help teams identify and fix issues, and track progress towards goals. This can include using tools such as monitoring, logging, and analytics platforms to gather and analyze data.

By following these steps, teams can adopt a DevOps approach and improve the speed and quality of their software delivery. It's important to note that DevOps is not a one-time implementation, but rather a continuous process of improvement and evolution.

DevOps can be beneficial for companies of any size, although the specific benefits and the ways in which DevOps is implemented may vary depending on the size and complexity of the organization.

For smaller companies, DevOps can help improve the speed and efficiency of software delivery, allowing them to bring new products and features to market more quickly and respond to customer needs more effectively. DevOps can also help smaller companies reduce the risk of errors and outages, and improve the reliability and performance of their systems.

For larger companies, DevOps can help streamline and automate complex processes, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of software delivery at scale. DevOps can also help large organizations reduce the risk of errors and outages, and improve the reliability and performance of their systems.

Overall, DevOps can be beneficial for companies of any size by improving the speed and quality of software delivery, reducing the risk of errors and outages, and improving the reliability and performance of systems. However, it's important to carefully consider the specific needs and goals of the organization and plan an implementation strategy that is appropriate for the company's size and complexity.

If you are looking to start with DevOps, here are some general steps that you can follow:

1. Establish a clear understanding of the goals and benefits of DevOps: Before starting to implement DevOps, it's important to have a clear understanding of what you hope to achieve and how DevOps can help. This may involve identifying specific pain points or challenges that DevOps can address, as well as the broader benefits that you hope to achieve.
2. Build a cross-functional team: DevOps relies on close collaboration and communication between different teams, so it's important to bring together a diverse group of individuals from different departments and functions. This team should include developers, operations staff, and any other relevant stakeholders.
3. Identify and prioritize areas for improvement: Once you have established a team, you can begin identifying and prioritizing areas for improvement. This may involve analyzing current processes and identifying bottlenecks or inefficiencies, as well as defining specific goals and metrics for measuring progress.
4. Choose tools and technologies: There are many tools and technologies available to support DevOps, and the specific ones that you choose will depend on your specific needs and goals. It's important to carefully evaluate different options and choose tools that will support your goals and workflows.
5. Establish a culture of continuous improvement: Building a culture of continuous improvement is key to the success of DevOps. This means fostering a mindset of shared responsibility and openness to change across all teams, and encouraging regular communication and feedback.

By following these steps, you can start to implement DevOps in your organization and begin reaping the benefits of improved collaboration and efficiency. It's important to remember that DevOps is not a one-time implementation, but rather a continuous process of improvement and evolution.

### Conclusions

Alright so… as mentioned that was all AI generated. Let me know in the comments below what you think about it. It was not too bad, was it? Actually fairly accurate… few strange things here and there but I’d say not bad.

The images on the other side… well, let’s say the result is questionable… they didn’t make much sense, and especially the writings on them was on a completely unreadable fake language… nice try OpenAI, nice try…

Anyway, that’s all I have for you today. But before going, check out [this video over here, in which I talk about what, for me, are the real benefits of doing DevOps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxDtADXeyv8) 🙂
