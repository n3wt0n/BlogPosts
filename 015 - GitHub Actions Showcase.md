GitHub Actions is now the most popular Build Platform on GitHub. But it is also much more than a CI system: it is a very powerful __automation engine__.

Let's take a look at how we can do CI with Actions, and how we can automate operations on our GitHub projects.

### Intro

Today I want to talk about GitHub Actions, and explore with you what we can do with it. Many people in fact think that Actions are just meant for CI CD. But in reality the service does much more than that.

It is a pretty powerful automation platform that is able to respond to __more than 90 events__, including of course the code push to the repo, which will indeed start a CI run, but also many others that are not related to code.
For example, you can do something whenever a user creates a _new Issue_, or when they open a _Pull Request_. Or even when a new _comment_ is added.
Basically, ___if you can automate it you can do it with Actions___!

To show you what you can do with Actions, I created some examples (which I have also used during the _Hong Kong Opensource_ conference I've presented at last week) and I've gone through them in the video below.

### Conclusion

This was a quick showcase of what you can do with GitHub Actions.

But as I've said before, you are by no means limited to what I've shown you here. You can do much much more.

You can take a look at the example in the [Github Repo](https://github.com/n3wt0n/HKOSConf2020) I've created, and please __leave me a comment below__ to let me know:

1. Do you already use Actions for something non CICD-related?
2. What do you think of GitHub Actions?
3. Do you have any other question?
