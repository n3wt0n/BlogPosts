What are Feature Flags (or Feature Toggles)? How do they work? Why they are important?

__Feature Flags are a super important tool__ to use in your application, but many are still confused about them

⏲️ The overall outline of the video is:

- What are Feature Flags
- Release vs Deployment
- Feature Flag Implementation theory
- Continuous Experimentation
- Platforms with Feature Flags
- Controlling Feature Flags
- Recap

Enjoy the watch!
