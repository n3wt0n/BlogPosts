When you use containers for your application, one of the things you need to think about is how to move (aka promote) the container images you generate across different environments.

In this series, I will explore different ways to do so... with the help of __Azure DevOps__

### Intro

In the first article of the series we explored the "Base Registry" approach to promote a Container image across different environments.  
In the second part we got rid of the additional registry and we used a Build Artifact.  
In the third and final part we have used the same approach as the second one, but using 100% the __YAML Pipelines__ (or, more appropriately, the ___Multi-stage Pipelines___).

In this ___bonus post___ you can find the link to the __YouTube video__ where I explain this approach.

### The video

I decided to create this video to explain the theory behind this approac, and also to show in practice how this is achieved with Azure DevOps.

Here you have it:
