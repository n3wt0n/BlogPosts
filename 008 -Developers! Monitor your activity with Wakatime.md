So, you are a developer, and you want to know how much time you spend coding.

Or maybe you are a freelancer, and you need to have a reliable way to measure the time you spend on a specific project so you can invoice your client.

Or yet, what if you are a dev lead who wants to know how the team is performing.

Well, today I have the tool for you. Wakatime!

Alright, so... what is Wakatime?

Basically, it's a platform that integrates in your IDEs and other development tools and track the time you spend coding.

They have more than 50 plugins that allow you to integrate to your tools and IDEs like Visual Studio, VS Code, Eclipse, XCode, Sublime and many more.

It can also integrate directly with GitHub, Office365 and others.

When you type in your editor, Wakatime logs the Project name, the file type (so you can then understand you were working on C#, SQL, Python, etc) and the tool itself. Of course no sensitive information is collected. All the plugins are open source so you can go and check what is actually collected.

But enough talking, let's see it in action.

I mainly use it for myself, because I wanna know how much time I spend on different projects and languages and because, to be honest, I like metrics and stuff like that.

What do you think? Let me know in the comment section below if you use Wakatime, and why. Or if you use other similar tools.
