GitHub recently announced the possibility to __automatically merge a Pull Request__ into the main branch. Let's see how.

### Intro 

Today I will show you how to use the brand new Pull Request auto-merge feature recently announced from GitHub and why I think it is __pretty useful__.

Right now when you submit a pull request on on GitHub you often have to spend a lot of time __waiting for approval__, status checks to complete, etc.

And then you gotta remember to check back in so that you can actually have the code merged. And if you forget to do that, or if you wait a day or two, sometimes even other changes come in and you have to redo your pull request.

This new feature basically lets the developer submit a Pull Request to a code base and __mark it to be automatically merged in__ when approved and all the checks have passed.

### Video

Alright, let's see __how to enable and use__ it.

This is much easier to see and explain with a demo:

### Conclusions

Of course this is totally __optional__, but it is a significant time savings and improving experience. And there is a way for repo admins or org admins to ___disable___ it if they don't want their PRs to be automatically merged.

What do you think of this new feature? Are you going to use it? I think it is pretty cool, and if you are like me, working with teams distributed through different timezone, it is gonna save time because if I have to wait for other people to approve my PRs I often then forget to merge them manually.
