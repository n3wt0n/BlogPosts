GitHub Codespaces is a great service. But did you know that GitHub Engineering has switched over to it, so now __GitHub uses Codespaces to build GitHub__?

In this live stream, we talk with Mike McQuaid (Staff Software Engineer at GitHub) about how GitHub uses Codespaces to Build GitHub, the challenges, the gains, and the future of how GitHub builds GitHub.

The GitHub.com codebase is almost 14 years old. And over those 14 years, the core repository powering GitHub has seen over a million commits And over the past months, GitHub's Engineering has evolved and moved to GitHub Codespaces for the majority of GitHub development.

This is your chance to discover how GitHub uses GitHub to build GitHub :)
